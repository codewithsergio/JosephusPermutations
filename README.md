# JosephusPermutations
Wrote an algorithm that solves for m in (X,m)-J-Permutation (a set of numbers); where x is the number of elements in the set. While solving the problem brute force on paper, I noticed a pattern when doing the mod of what's left in the array, it always gave the "count" of the next element that needs to be in the set. With this, my algorithm works with all sets.
